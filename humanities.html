	<h1>Humanities</h1>
	<p>Humanities: quite possibly the funniest, most enjoyable, most stressful, most interactive class ever. An English-history
		combo, this class was (is) taught by two of the most wonderful teachers and people ever. Their bromance never fails to
		make me smile. Neither does their flirting - even though they're both married. They made the class incredibly interesting,

				<h4>October-November 2019</h4>

				<h4>04/08/20</h4>
				<p>This is one of my Pandemic works, hence the "timed" nature of it. It considers the nature of desire and identity in the novel Girl With A Pearl Earring.</p>
